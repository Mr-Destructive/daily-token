While it excels at automating repetitive tasks like dashboard creation and SQL queries (potentially disrupting OLAP roles), skepticism remains about its uniqueness and long-term viability. The bigger concern: **AI\u2019s accelerating pace is outstripping compute power and job security**, with departments already cutting 10\u201315% of roles as low-hanging fruit gets automated. The core lesson? *Adapt or risk obsolescence*\u2014but demand better tools, not just hype.* Quote: \"I have already seen some of our department cutting down 10-15% [of staff]...
