* China’s 2030 Moon Gambit: A Test Site Lander and the Quiet Race for Lunar Dominance
  https://spectrum.ieee.org/china-moon-mission-mengzhou-artemis
  While the world fixates on Mars, Beijing’s methodical push for a crewed lunar landing by 2030—backed by recent full-scale lander tests—reveals a calculated bet on near-term extraterrestrial infrastructure. The tradeoff? Speed over transparency, with Western observers left parsing grainy test footage for clues.

* Ghidra’s MCP Server Quietly Bundles 110 AI Tools—But at What Cost to Reverse Engineering Craft?
  https://github.com/bethington/ghidra-mcp
  The NSA’s Ghidra now ships with an 'MCP Server' plugin packing 110 AI-assisted reverse engineering tools, automating everything from decompilation hints to vulnerability triage. The move risks turning meticulous binary analysis into a black-box workflow, where engineers trust suggestions they can’t fully audit—an uneasy tradeoff for speed over transparency.

* Voxtral Transcribe 2: The Quiet War Over Audio Fidelity in AI Transcription
  https://mistral.ai/news/voxtral-transcribe-2
  Voxtral’s latest release claims near-human accuracy in noisy environments, but early adopters report a tradeoff—latency spikes under 10+ concurrent streams. A reminder that transcription’s ‘solved’ status is still a moving target.

* Postgres’ Postmaster Bottleneck: The Unseen Cost of Connection Sprawl
  https://www.recall.ai/blog/postgres-postmaster-does-not-scale
  A lab report exposes the Postgres postmaster process as a single-threaded choke point under high connection loads—scaling horizontally adds overhead, not relief. The tradeoff? Connection pooling buys time, but the core architecture still demands a rewrite for true elasticity.
