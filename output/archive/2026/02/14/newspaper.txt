EDITOR'S NOTE: When machines outpace the peer review, the real question isn’t whether they’re right—it’s who’s left to ask.

THE FRONT PAGE
------------------------------------------------
* GPT-5.2 Cracks a Physics Proof—But Who Checks the Work?
  https://openai.com/index/new-result-theoretical-physics/
  OpenAI’s latest model independently derived a novel result in quantum field theory, verified by three peer-reviewed teams—though the process’s opacity leaves mathematicians debating whether it’s a tool or a collaborator. The milestone arrives as labs quietly phase out human postdocs for 'preprint assistants.'

* Open-Source Data Engineering Guide Gains Traction—But Can It Outlast the Hype?
  https://github.com/datascale-ai/data_engineering_book/blob/main/README_en.md
  A community-driven, open-source *Data Engineering Book* is quietly assembling best practices, though its long-term maintenance remains an open question in a field notorious for tool churn. The project’s collaborative model may either democratize knowledge or drown in its own ambition.

* IronClaw: Rust’s WASM Gambit for Safer Tool Execution
  https://github.com/nearai/ironclaw
  A new Rust-based runtime, IronClaw, isolates arbitrary tools in WASM sandboxes—promising security without the usual performance tax, though adoption hinges on whether devs trust WASM’s edge cases. The project’s raw utility might outshine its unpolished branding.

* Zvec: The In-Process Vector Database That Skips the Network Tax
  https://github.com/alibaba/zvec
  A new Rust-based vector store, Zvec, embeds directly into applications, trading distributed scalability for sub-millisecond latency and zero serialization overhead. The catch? It’s a single-node bet—no sharding, no fault tolerance beyond what your host process offers.

* "OpenClaw Was a Liability": Engineer Swaps Framework for Mac Mini and Blink, Claims Tighter Security
  https://coder.com/blog/why-i-ditched-openclaw-and-built-a-more-secure-ai-agent-on-blink-mac-mini
  A developer abandoned the OpenClaw agent framework—citing unmanageable attack surfaces—and replaced it with a stripped-down Mac Mini running Blink, arguing the tradeoff in flexibility yields measurable gains in isolation. The move underscores how even open-source security tools can become technical debt when their abstractions outpace real-world threat models.

* "Postgres Locks: The Silent Tax on Your Queries"
  https://postgreslocksexplained.com/
  A forensic dive into Postgres’ locking mechanisms reveals how even well-tuned systems bleed performance through contention—useful for engineers who’ve accepted latency as inevitable. The tradeoff? Debugging tools still lag behind the complexity they’re meant to untangle.
