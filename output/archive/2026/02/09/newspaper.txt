* AI Agents Take Over SimCity: A REST API Experiment in Urban Planning
  https://hallucinatingsplines.com
  A team of hobbyist engineers repurposed SimCity’s mechanics via a custom REST API, letting autonomous agents manage zoning, budgets, and disasters—raising questions about whether such systems reveal emergent strategy or just exploit brittle game logic. The project’s open-ended nature leaves its practical value unclear, but the spectacle is undeniable.

* AirPods Pro 4 Rumored to Embed Cameras—At What Cost to Privacy?
