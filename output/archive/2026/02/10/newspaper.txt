* Rowboat: Open-Source AI Coworker Maps Workflows to Knowledge Graphs—But Will It Scale?
  https://github.com/rowboatlabs/rowboat
  Rowboat, a new OSS tool, automatically constructs a knowledge graph from user workflows (e.g., docs, code, chats) to surface implicit connections—promising efficiency gains for teams but raising questions about graph maintenance overhead and privacy tradeoffs in collaborative settings.

* Livedocs (YC W22) Debuts AI-Native Notebook, But Can It Outperform Jupyter for Data Teams?
  https://livedocs.com
  Y Combinator-backed Livedocs launches an AI-integrated notebook targeting data analysts, promising tighter collaboration and automation—yet faces adoption hurdles against entrenched tools like Jupyter and Hex. Early traction in niche workflows suggests potential, but scalability and customization tradeoffs remain unproven.

* Open-Source SDK Aims to Streamline AI Knowledge Work—But Will It Scale?
  https://github.com/ClioAI/kw-sdk
  A newly released open-source SDK promises to simplify AI-driven knowledge tasks by abstracting common workflows, though adoption hinges on community buy-in and integration with existing toolchains. Early adopters report reduced boilerplate but warn of steep learning curves for non-specialists.
