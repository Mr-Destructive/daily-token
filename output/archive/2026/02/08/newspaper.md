## Editor's Note
Another benchmark exposes the chasm between AI’s promise and its practice—yet the tools to bridge it are being built, one sandboxed failure at a time.

### Benchmark Reveals AI’s 96% Failure Rate on Real-World Tasks—Again

A new evaluation framework exposed that leading AI models collapse on 96%+ of complex, multi-step tasks—echoing 2023’s benchmarks but with sharper focus on workflow integration. The tradeoff? Models optimized for narrow accuracy still can’t navigate ambiguity without human scaffolding.

### Qwen2.5-7B Tuned on 100 Films: When LLMs Start Writing Screenplays (Probabilistically)

A lone developer fine-tuned Qwen2.5-7B on 100 films to generate probabilistic story graphs—useful for writers, perhaps, but the output’s narrative coherence remains an open question. The experiment highlights how lightweight tuning can repurpose models for niche creative tasks, though at the cost of predictable hallucinations in plot structure.

### LocalGPT: Rust’s Quiet Bid for AI That Stays on Your Machine—And Remembers

A Rust-built AI assistant claims persistent local memory without cloud leakage, trading off model scale for user control. The real test isn’t the tech but whether developers will tolerate the maintenance burden of truly *local* AI.

### "Matchlock" Locks Down AI Agents in a Linux Sandbox—But at What Cost to Performance?

A new Linux-based sandbox, *Matchlock*, isolates AI agent workloads with kernel-level enforcement, trading raw execution speed for hardened security—a rare admission that even 'autonomous' agents still need old-school OS discipline. The catch? Early adopters report 12-18% latency overhead in agent response loops.
