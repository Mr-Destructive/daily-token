While the world fixates on Mars, Beijing’s methodical push for a crewed lunar landing by 2030—backed by recent full-scale lander tests—reveals a calculated bet on near-term extraterrestrial infrastructure. The tradeoff? Speed over transparency, with Western observers left parsing grainy test footage for clues.

The NSA’s Ghidra now ships with an 'MCP Server' plugin packing 110 AI-assisted reverse engineering tools, automating everything from decompilation hints to vulnerability triage. The move risks turning meticulous binary analysis into a black-box workflow, where engineers trust suggestions they can’t fully audit—an uneasy tradeoff for speed over transparency.
