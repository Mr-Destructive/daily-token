EDITOR'S NOTE: The gap between lab-grade AI and the world’s stubborn complexity grows wider—yet the engineers still show up, wrenches in hand.

* Game Arena: Where AI Benchmarks Meet the Real World’s Messy Rules
  https://blog.google/innovation-and-ai/models-and-research/google-deepmind/kaggle-game-arena-updates/
  Google’s new *Game Arena* framework pits AI agents against imperfect, human-like game environments—not polished simulations—exposing how brittle today’s benchmarks really are. The tradeoff? More honest metrics, but at the cost of reproducibility chaos.

* Nano-vLLM: The Uncomfortable Tradeoff Between Latency and Memory in Edge Inference
  https://neutree.ai/blog/nano-vllm-part-1
  A new vLLM-derived engine, Nano-vLLM, squeezes large language models into edge devices by aggressively pruning KV caches and quantizing attention—gaining 2x throughput at the cost of subtle, unmeasured accuracy drift in long-context tasks. The usual silence on failure modes speaks louder than the benchmarks.

* Firefox Quietly Embeds AI Controls—But Who’s Watching the Watchers?
  https://blog.mozilla.org/en/firefox/ai-controls/
  Mozilla’s latest Firefox update buries AI-driven 'controls' deep in its lab notes, raising the usual questions: convenience at what cost, and will users even notice before it’s too late? The move feels less like innovation and more like another quiet concession to the algorithmic tide.
