EDITOR'S NOTE: The industry’s pivot from alchemy to architecture arrives—not a moment too soon, though the ledger of tradeoffs grows longer by the day.

* GLM-5 Aims for the Gaps Where Most LLMs Stumble: Systems Engineering and Long-Horizon Autonomy
  https://z.ai/blog/glm-5
  The latest from Tsinghua’s team isn’t chasing benchmark hype—it’s targeting the unglamorous, high-failure domains where today’s models still require human babysitting: multi-agent coordination, months-long task decomposition, and the kind of systems engineering that actually ships products. The tradeoff? Narrower pretraining data, betting that depth in technical domains will outweigh breadth.

* GLM-5 Shifts from Vibe-Driven Code to Agentic Rigor—At What Cost?
  https://z.ai/blog/glm-5
  The latest GLM iteration abandons the loose heuristics of 'vibe coding' for structured agentic workflows, a move that may restore discipline to LLM development—or bury it under new layers of abstraction. Early adopters report a 30% drop in hallucination rates, but debugging now requires tracing nested sub-agent decisions.

* El Paso Airport Grounded by Drone: A Case of Automation Outpacing Protocol
  https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/11/us/faa-el-paso-flight-restrictions.html
  An unidentified drone incursion forced El Paso International to halt operations for two hours yesterday, exposing gaps in counter-UAS integration at civilian airports. The FAA’s reliance on manual detection—while airspace deconfliction algorithms sit in regulatory limbo—raises questions about whether safety systems are being outpaced by off-the-shelf consumer tech.

* Tambo 1.0: The Agent Framework That Renders React—And the Tradeoffs It Ignores
  https://github.com/tambo-ai/tambo
  Tambo’s open-source toolkit lets developers build agents that dynamically render React components, collapsing the boundary between backend logic and frontend UX. The elegance comes at a cost: tighter coupling between systems and a steeper debugging curve when React’s state management collides with agentic workflows.
