## Editor's Note
The industry’s rush to agentic systems risks mistaking benchmark theater for actual progress—yet the quiet shifts in GLM-5’s architecture suggest a path beyond the hype, if we dare to look.

The latest from Zhipu AI, GLM-5, pivots toward complex systems engineering and multi-step agentic workflows, a rare admission that today’s models still fumble at sustained reasoning. The tradeoff? Its ambitions collide with the industry’s addiction to narrow metrics—usefulness in production remains an open question.
