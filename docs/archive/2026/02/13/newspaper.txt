* Engineer Replaces OpenClaw with Custom Mac Mini–Blink Agent, Citing Security Gaps in Open-Source Frameworks
  https://coder.com/blog/why-i-ditched-openclaw-and-built-a-more-secure-ai-agent-on-blink-mac-mini
  A developer abandoned the OpenClaw AI agent framework due to perceived architectural vulnerabilities, opting instead for a self-hosted solution combining a Mac Mini and Blink’s sandboxing. The move underscores persistent tradeoffs between open-source convenience and control over attack surfaces in production AI systems.
