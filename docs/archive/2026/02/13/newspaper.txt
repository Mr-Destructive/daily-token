EDITOR'S NOTE: The tools we build now remember more than we do—yet the real question isn’t whether they’ll outlast our craft, but whether we’ll bother to teach them what matters.

* Moltis: The Assistant That Remembers, Builds, and Grows—At What Cost to Craft?
  https://www.moltis.org
  A new open-source AI assistant, Moltis, ships with persistent memory, modular tooling, and self-extending capabilities—raising the bar for personal automation while quietly sidestepping the maintenance debt such systems inevitably accrue. The tradeoff? Users inherit the complexity of an ever-evolving stack, where 'skills' may outpace their own understanding of them.

* Engineer Replaces OpenClaw with a Mac Mini and a Blink Script—Claims Better Security at Half the Cost
  https://coder.com/blog/why-i-ditched-openclaw-and-built-a-more-secure-ai-agent-on-blink-mac-mini
  A developer abandoned the OpenClaw agent framework in favor of a minimalist setup: a Mac Mini running a custom Blink script, citing fewer attack surfaces and no dependency bloat. The tradeoff? Manual orchestration now eats 12% of dev time—but the system’s audit logs fit on a single terminal screen.

* Cloudflare Quietly Hands AI Agents a Real-Time Markdown Pipeline—And a New Attack Surface
  https://blog.cloudflare.com/markdown-for-agents/
  Cloudflare’s Workers AI now renders Markdown in real time, letting agents dynamically format responses without client-side processing. The move shifts rendering logic to the edge—convenient for latency, but another layer of abstraction for security teams to audit.
