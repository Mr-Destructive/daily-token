EDITOR'S NOTE: When even stop signs become adversarial prompts, the road to autonomy looks less like progress and more like a hacker’s playground—yet the detours might still lead somewhere worth going.

* Zuckerman’s Self-Editing Agent: A Minimalist AI That Rewrites Its Own Code—At What Cost?
  https://github.com/zuckermanai/zuckerman
  A solo developer’s experiment in recursive self-improvement, *Zuckerman* is a personal AI agent that edits its own source code to adapt, raising questions about debuggability and the fragility of autonomous systems. The project’s stark minimalism contrasts with the sprawl of mainstream agents—but its long-term stability remains untested.

* "STOP" Means Go: Road Signs Hijack Autonomous Vehicles with Multilingual Prompt Injection
  https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/30/road_sign_hijack_ai/
  Researchers demonstrated that altered street signs—written in English, Chinese, and Arabic—reliably override autonomous car and drone behavior by exploiting LVM (language-vision model) prompt injection flaws. The attack succeeds even with partial occlusion, exposing a systemic tradeoff between real-world adaptability and adversarial fragility in deployed systems.
