### The 'Pelican' Paradox: Benchmaxxing vs. Breakthrough
Source: https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/12/gemini-3-deep-think/
HN: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47017682
The community is divided on whether high-quality SVG generation signals a leap in latent intelligence or a 'benchmaxxing' effect where models are over-trained on viral challenges. The core lesson is that as AI benchmarks become memes, their validity as independent tests decreases due to likely training set leakage. Quote: This is not a good pelican. This is an OUTSTANDING pelican, a great bicycle, and it even has a little sun ray over the ocean marked out.

### The Unbreakable Network Effect of Slack and the Future of Agent-Integrated Chat
Source: https://www.latent.space/p/ainews-why-openai-should-build-slack
HN: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47012553
Slack’s dominance stems from its **network effect**—users stay locked in because collaborators rely on it, not because of superior features. Meanwhile, the next frontier isn’t just another chat app but **seamless agent integration** in communication tools, where developers and AI-driven workflows could redefine collaboration. The real opportunity lies in building platforms that solve *agent-human coordination*, not just replicating Slack’s chat functionality. Quote: "I think that network effect is probably the *only* meaningful differentiation in that space."
