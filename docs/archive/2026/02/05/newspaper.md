## Editor's Note
The pendulum swings back toward iron as cloud orthodoxy cracks—yet the real question isn’t where code runs, but who still remembers how to run it.

A new terminal-based browser, *Smooth CLI*, strips web interaction down to token-efficient primitives, trading human usability for AI agent autonomy. The project’s bet: agents need lean, deterministic interfaces more than they need the bloated DOM.

### Benchmarking AI Code Review: A Reality Check for Engineering Teams

HN: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46891860
A new real-world benchmark for AI-assisted code review surfaces hard tradeoffs between false positives and developer trust—suggesting tools may still demand more human oversight than vendors admit. The findings quietly undermine the 'autonomous PR review' narrative.

### Morph’s PR Videos: A Debugging Theater or the End of ‘Works on My Machine’?

GitHub PRs now host AI-generated videos of code changes in action—spotting visual regressions and edge cases developers might miss. The tool trades raw log precision for cinematic debugging, raising questions about whether engineers will watch the film or just skip to the plot twist.

### Open-Source Tool Outperforms LLMs in Literature Reviews—With Fewer Hallucinations

A new open-source AI system, designed for academic literature synthesis, has demonstrated superior accuracy in citation handling compared to commercial LLMs, raising questions about whether specialized tools can reclaim ground lost to general-purpose models. The tradeoff? It requires domain-specific fine-tuning that most labs lack the resources to maintain.

### Elixir’s Unlikely Gambit: A Functional Language Bets on AI’s Scalability Crisis

Dashbit argues Elixir’s BEAM VM and fault-tolerant concurrency model outperform Python’s GIL-bound stacks for production AI—but the tradeoff is a steeper learning curve and a niche talent pool. The claim hinges on real-time systems where Erlang’s telecom roots still matter.

George Hotz’s team abandoned AWS for a self-built datacenter, citing 40% cost savings and latency gains—but now they’re debugging PDUs at 3 AM instead of shipping features. A rare glimpse at the unglamorous tradeoffs of 'owning' infrastructure in 2026.
