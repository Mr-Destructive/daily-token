EDITOR'S NOTE: The industry’s rush to contain AI’s chaos with WebAssembly feels like using a tea strainer to hold back a flood—yet here we are, watching engineers bet on the wrong kind of alchemy again.

* OpenClaw Drops Another Name, Leaves Engineers Guessing on Stability
  https://openclaw.ai/blog/introducing-openclaw
  The model formerly known as Moltbot has rebranded *again* to OpenClaw—raising questions about architectural consistency amid a pattern of rapid identity shifts. Early adopters report friction in migration paths, while the team cites 'strategic clarity' as justification.

* WASM-Bound Bash: Amla Sandbox Tries to Tame AI Agents with WebAssembly
  https://github.com/amlalabs/amla-sandbox
  A new project, Amla Sandbox, isolates AI agents in a WASM-based bash shell—promising safer execution but trading off the overhead of WebAssembly’s linear memory model. The usual question lingers: will developers trust it enough to stop wrapping their scripts in `timeout` and `docker run --rm`?
