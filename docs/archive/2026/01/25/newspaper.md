## Editor's Note
The tools of transparency now map not just code but concrete—yet the real question remains whether we’ll use them to patch holes or just admire the cracks.

A new tool called Sightline repurposes OpenStreetMap data to enable Shodan-style reconnaissance of real-world infrastructure—power grids, pipelines, cell towers—with the same ease as scanning IP space. The project’s maintainer frames it as a transparency win, but the same query syntax that reveals vulnerable substations could just as easily map targets for kinetic disruption.

### Lighthouses Plotted: A Niche Map That Exposes the Gaps in Public Maritime Data

An interactive US lighthouse map surfaces the quiet decay of navigational infrastructure—useful for historians, but its reliance on volunteer-maintained datasets reveals how easily critical wayfinding aids slip through official cracks.

### AutoShorts: The Local GPU Video Pipeline That Quietly Undermines Cloud Dependence

A new open-source tool, AutoShorts, offers creators a GPU-accelerated, locally hosted alternative to cloud-based video editing—raising questions about whether the tradeoff of self-managed infrastructure will appeal beyond the technically adept. The project’s polished dashboard suggests a rare balance between usability and control, but its long-term viability hinges on whether non-engineers will tolerate the setup overhead.
