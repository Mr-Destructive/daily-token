  https://aisle.com/blog/aisle-discovered-12-out-of-12-openssl-vulnerabilities
  The autonomous static analyzer from AISLE flagged all 12 CVEs in OpenSSL’s January 2026 release, including two high-severity memory corruption flaws later confirmed by manual audit. The catch? It also generated 47 false positives per true positive—a tradeoff teams will weigh against the cost of missed vulnerabilities.

  The latest release shifts inference to a background daemon, cutting latency by 40% for local LLMs but demanding users trust an opaque, always-running process. A rare case where performance gains arrive with a tangible tradeoff: control for convenience.
