While Tambo\u2019s approach excels for rapid prototyping and agent flexibility, critics warn of reliability risks when AI generates UI on-the-fly. The sweet spot may lie in hybrid systems\u2014using structured schemas (like Zod) as a 'source of truth' to balance dynamism with predictability. For production, 'batteries-included' frameworks often struggle to scale, suggesting modularity and interoperability (e.g., A2UI compatibility) will define long-term winners.

While Tambo\u2019s approach excels for rapid prototyping and agent flexibility, critics warn of reliability risks when AI generates UI on-the-fly. The sweet spot may lie in hybrid systems\u2014using structured schemas (like Zod) as a 'source of truth' to balance dynamism with predictability. For production, 'batteries-included' frameworks often struggle to scale, suggesting modularity and interoperability (e.g., A2UI compatibility) will define long-term winners.
